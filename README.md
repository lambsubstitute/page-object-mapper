# page-object-mapper
my own useful page object mapper for watir-webdriver 

work in progress

page object mapper designed to be plugged in to a feature file and out put a standard set of methods for each main element type (links, buttons, text fields, ect). 

This is designed to make my own page object model mapping files for my own page object model and not the standard documented version of the model.
